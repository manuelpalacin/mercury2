			<p>You can participate in the Mercury project by executing the Mercury Client from your home. 
				Simply, download the Mercury Client here for Windows. The client requires Microsoft Framework 4.
				Once, you have dowloaded the client, you just need to execute the application using administrator privileges 
				(right click on the executable and select "Run as administrator"). It is also required that you disable the Windows Firewall.
				The application will run in back-ground and will stop when it will finish.
